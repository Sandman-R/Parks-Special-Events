    "text": "1 Introduction\nPublic life in New York City is closely tied to its parks. Throughout the year, parks host a wide range of activities—from seasonal festivals and fitness programs to mobile units and small neighborhood events. As a foreigner, it’s a good way to get to understand the local life from those events.\nOn the other hand, the arrival of COVID-19 disrupted such rhythm abruptly. Many park events might be canceled or scaled back. It’s also meaningful to look through these patterns to see the effects from the pandemic.\nThis project examines how NYC park events evolved before, during, and after the pandemic. Specifically, it focuses on three dimensions of change: the timing of events throughout the year, the composition of event categories over time, and the spatial distribution of attendance across the city. By comparing these dimensions across multiple years, the analysis traces how the pandemic disrupted existing patterns and how public life gradually re-emerged in new forms.",

This dataset is available as a CSV file and is officially updated on a monthly basis, although the underlying records may change more frequently (approximately weekly). In addition, newly recorded events appear in the public portal with about a one-month delay.\nWe downloaded the data from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Special-Events/6v4b-5gp4/about_data.\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"Parks_Special_Events_20251027.csv\")\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(LocationType == \"Park\")\n\n# head(df)\nThe data set contains 20.8k rows and 13 columns. Its main dimensions include Unit, Date and Time, Borough, Location, Event Type, Category, Classification, Attendance, Audience and so on.\nTo enhance the spatial component of our analysis, we incorporated a second dataset from NYC Open Data: Parks Properties. This dataset provides detailed geographic boundaries for every park in the form of multipolygon.\nWe downloaded the data from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Parks-Properties/enfh-gkve/about_data.\nCode\nparks &lt;- read.csv(\"Parks_Properties_20251209.csv\")\n\n# head(parks)\nBy linking park names across the two datasets, these geometries allow us to locate each event spatially and generate higher-resolution maps—such as centroid-based hexbin visualizations—that go beyond a coarse borough-level view.",

We can see from Figure 3.2 that fitness, sport and KIM related programs show sharply peaked distributions centered around the mid of the year, showing the preference on summer conditions. In contrast, arts and culture as well as family festival events exhibit broader spreads, suggesting greater flexibility. These patterns suggest that the seasonal rhythm of park usage is not uniform, but is structured by the functional nature of events.\n\n\nCode\ndf_hex &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Attendance_num), !is.na(doy)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Attendance_capped = pmin(\n      Attendance_num,\n      quantile(Attendance_num, 0.99, na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(df_hex, aes(x = doy, y = Attendance_capped)) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 20, color = NA) +\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(\n  colours = c(\"#e0f3f8\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#74add1\", \"#4575b4\", \"#313695\"),\n  # trans   = \"log10\",\n  name    = \"Count\"\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Attendance vs Day-of-Year\",\n    x = \"Day of Year\",\n    y = \"Attendance\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Hex map for Attendance & Day of year\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hexbin heatmap of attendance versus day-of-year(Figure 3.3) shows that the seasonal increase in park activity is driven primarily by a large number of small- to mid-sized events. The highest concentration of events occurs during the summer months with attendance levels between approximately 5 and 20 participants. In contrast, high-attendance events are relatively rare and distributed sparsely across the year.\nThis pattern suggests that peak park usage reflects frequent, lower-density gatherings rather than occasional large-scale events, highlighting the role of parks as flexible spaces for decentralized public activity.",

But surprisingly, we can see from Figure 3.4 that with the immediate impact of COVID-19 restrictions, the number of events in 2020 is higher compared to the other years. Looking at the poportion over different categories, there’s a huge decrease on the number of Mobile Unit-related events.\n\n\nCode\ndf_year &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year), year &gt;= 2019, !is.na(Category))\n\ntop_cat &lt;- df_year |&gt;\n  count(Category, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 7) |&gt;\n  pull(Category)\n\ndf_year_filtered &lt;- df_year |&gt;\n  filter(Category %in% top_cat)\n\nsummary_df_year_att &lt;- df_year_filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(year, Category) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    total_attendance = sum(Attendance_num, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year     = factor(year),\n    Category = fct_infreq(Category)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(\n  summary_df_year_att,\n  aes(\n    x        = year,\n    stratum  = Category,\n    alluvium = Category,\n    y        = total_attendance,\n    fill     = Category\n  )\n) +\n  geom_flow(\n    stat          = \"alluvium\",\n    lode.guidance = \"frontback\",\n    color         = \"grey60\",\n    alpha         = 0.8\n  ) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 0.3, color = \"grey30\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\", name = \"Category\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"NYC Event Categories by Total Attendance Over Time\",\n    x     = \"Year\",\n    y     = \"Total Attendance\"\n  ) +\n  theme_edav()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: NYC attendence for events(different categories) over years\n\n\n\n\n\nTo study the strange pattern in the first alluvial graph, we plot the total attendance instead of number of events(shown in Figure 3.5). When examining total attendance, a different recovery pattern emerges. While event counts is high during pandemics, total attendance is obviously lower than in any other years, particularly for mobile unit and family festival programs. This indicates that those events happened during pandemics is mostly made up of small scale events.\n\n\nCode\nmobile_df &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(Category == \"Mobile Unit\",\n         !is.na(Classification),\n    str_trim(Classification) != \"\" )\n\ntop_mobile_class &lt;- mobile_df |&gt;\n  count(Classification, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10) |&gt;\n  pull(Classification)\n\nmobile_year_class &lt;- mobile_df |&gt;\n  filter(Classification %in% top_mobile_class) |&gt;\n  count(year, Classification, name = \"n\") |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 2017) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year = factor(year),\n    Classification = fct_infreq(Classification)\n  )\n\nggplot(mobile_year_class,\n       aes(x = year, y = n, fill = Classification)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\", name = \"Classification\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mobile Unit Classification Trends Over Time\",\n    x     = \"Year\",\n    y     = \"Proportion\",\n    fill  = \"Classification\"\n  ) +\n  theme_edav()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Stack Bar Chart showing propotion of classifications for Mobile Unit over time\n\n\n\n\n\nSince mobile unit is a very important category of the events, and the category name itself doesn’t represent the function, we dive deeper into the detailed calssification to see the patterns.\nFrom Figure 3.6, we can see the proportional composition of mobile unit classifications shows a clear structural shift over time. Prior to the pandemic, mobile units were dominated by movie-related programming, reflecting their role as mobile entertainment platforms. In 2020, this structure collapses into a single, pandemic-specific classification, indicating an emergency-driven reorganization rather than gradual change.\nIn the post-pandemic period, mobile units increasingly shift toward M.U.T.S, play, and fitness-related functions. This new composition stabilizes after 2022 and does not return to pre-pandemic patterns, suggesting that mobile units evolved from cultural entertainment vehicles into flexible public service infrastructure.\n\n\nCode\nparks &lt;- parks |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    park_clean = NAME311 |&gt;      \n      tolower() |&gt;\n      str_replace_all(\"[^a-z0-9 ]\", \" \") |&gt;\n      str_squish()\n  )\n\ntheme_hex_small &lt;- function() {\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +\n    theme(\n      axis.text  = element_blank(),\n      axis.title = element_blank(),\n      axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text  = element_text(size = 7),\n      legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"in\"),\n      legend.key.width  = unit(0.15, \"in\")\n    )\n}\n\nplot_hex_for_year &lt;- function(year_sel, pal) {\n\n  park_attendance_year &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(year == year_sel, !is.na(park_clean)) |&gt;\n    group_by(park_clean) |&gt;\n    summarise(total_attendance = sum(Attendance_num, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n    ungroup()\n\n  parks_joined_year &lt;- parks |&gt;\n    left_join(park_attendance_year, by = \"park_clean\") |&gt;\n    mutate(total_attendance = replace_na(total_attendance, 0))\n\n  parks_valid_year &lt;- parks_joined_year |&gt;\n    st_make_valid()\n\n  parks_pts_year &lt;- parks_valid_year |&gt;\n    st_centroid(of_largest_polygon = TRUE) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      lon = st_coordinates(geometry)[, 1],\n      lat = st_coordinates(geometry)[, 2]\n    ) |&gt;\n    st_drop_geometry()\n\n  ggplot() +\n    stat_summary_hex(\n      data = parks_pts_year,\n      aes(x = lon, y = lat, z = total_attendance),\n      bins  = 20,\n      fun   = \"sum\",\n      color = NA\n    ) +\n    scale_fill_gradientn(\n      colours = pal,\n      name    = \"Total Attendance\"\n    ) +\n    geom_sf(\n      data      = nyc_outline,\n      fill      = NA,\n      color     = \"grey70\",\n      linewidth = 0.4\n    ) +\n    coord_sf() +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"NYC Events Attendance in\", year_sel),\n      x     = \"Longitude\",\n      y     = \"Latitude\"\n    ) +\n    theme_hex_small()\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\npal_blue &lt;- c(\"#e0f3f8\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#74add1\", \"#4575b4\", \"#313695\")\npal_red  &lt;- c(\"#fee5d9\", \"#fcae91\", \"#fb6a4a\", \"#de2d26\", \"#a50f15\")\n\np2019 &lt;- plot_hex_for_year(2019, pal_blue)\np2020 &lt;- plot_hex_for_year(2020, pal_red)\np2021 &lt;- plot_hex_for_year(2021, pal_blue)\np2022 &lt;- plot_hex_for_year(2022, pal_blue)\n\n(p2019 + p2020) / (p2021 + p2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Spatial patterns on different years\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7 shows a clear transformation over time.

In 2020, attendance levels dropped sharply and spatial hotspots largely disappeared, resulting in a more uniform distribution across the city.\nIn 2021 and 2022, attendance gradually recovered, with high-attendance areas re-emerging. However, these hotspots were more spatially distributed than in 2019, suggesting a shift toward a more decentralized pattern of park usage.",

    "text": "Our exploration shows that NYC park events exhibit strong seasonal patterns, and the COVID-19 pandemic substantially reshaped how these patterns were expressed over time and space. While event counts recovered in later years, total attendance remained lower than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more decentralized activities rather than a return to large gatherings. Changes in event composition further suggest structural adaptation, particularly among mobile unit programs, which turned from entertainment-focused uses to more flexible public service roles and did not revert after the pandemic. Spatial analysis reinforces this finding, showing that post-pandemic recovery produced a more distributed pattern of park usage instead of restoring pre-2020 concentration.\nThis analysis is limited by estimated attendance values, incomplete classifications during pandemic years, and a focus on public trends rather than individual behavior.\nFuture work could incorporate demographic, weather, or other kinds of event data to better explain uneven recovery across categories.\nOverall, the project demonstrates that city rhythms are not fixed but adaptive, and that major disruptions can lead to lasting changes in how public spaces are used.",
